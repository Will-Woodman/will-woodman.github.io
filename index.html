        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <p>I'm Will, a PhD student in statistics at Newcastle University working with Dr Tom Nye. My PhD work focussed on BHV tree space, aiming to fit probability distributions to data.
          BHV tree space was defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196885801907596.</p>

          </p>Methods exist for computing Fr√©chet means in BHV space but these are based on least squares approaches - they are not based on probabilistic reasoning and there is no likelihood to do Bayesian inference. </p>

         </p>We can sample from an analogue to Gaussiann distributions in BHV tree space by forward simulating Brownian Motion.
         Inferring parameters of these distribution given data sets of phylogenetic trees is challenging - this is what my research has focussed on.</p>

         </p>I am interested in data where some extra structure is imposed - this could be data that are themselves trees or graphs, or DNA sequence data that has evolved along the branches of some phylogenetic tree.. Check out the Code page to see my projects!</p>
